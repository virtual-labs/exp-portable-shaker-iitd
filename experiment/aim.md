#### This experiment aims to obtain the vibration response of a  3 m to 5.5 m long beam using a portable dynamic shaker. Unlike experiment 1 which deals with free vibration response, this experiment deals with forced vibration response. Using external shaker, the excitation can be effectively controlled. Modes otherwise missed out during impact excitation may be specifically excited.
